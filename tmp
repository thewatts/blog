I wanted to show this really cool site that I found uses depth in a cool way. It's a parallax site and as you scroll there is definite depth of field being used.

I've really been impressed with work done by [HappyCog](http://happycog.com/#work), who was founded by [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/).
He was the guy who really championed web standards, and the sites that his company makes are great. They really strive for usability, and make great stuff!
++ Checkout the breadcrumbs for [Zappos](http://www.zappos.com/mens-oxfords-shoes~36). I *really* feel that they fit for what the user is trying to do.

Regarding typefaces, check out : https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com - they make free typefaces that rock.

And also - http://sneakpeekit.com/ - wireframe design sheets!

Terrible Usability: any flash website :)

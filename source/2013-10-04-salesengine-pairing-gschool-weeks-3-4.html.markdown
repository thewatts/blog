The past two weeks, we spent our days (and nights) working on a project called [Sales
Engine](http://bit.ly/17BoaoP).

The project itself was great. It was challenging in some aspects, and allowed us
the opportunity to really apply the concepts that we had been learning during
our time here at gSchool (such as Test Driven Development and Object Oriented
Design).

The greatest opportunity though, in my opinion, was the opportunity given to us
to really dive into pair programming. It was a huge blessing to be paired with
[Quentin Tai](https://github.com/quillyt).

Personally, I love working with people - and so pairing is something that
really hits home for me.

*Working with Q, though, was better than I could have expected.*

The constant bouncing of ideas back and forth, the
mutual appreciation of hard work, the mututal celebration of
progress. It was stellar!

Honestly, it was a breeze.

I would love to share some insights I've found during the process though:

##### 1. Communication Is Key.

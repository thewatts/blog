> "One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular." â€” *Tony Robbins*

A week ago today, I started <a href="http://gschool.it" title="gSchool">gSchool</a>.

It was the culmination of months of prayer and preparation, moving my family away from comfort and community to an entirely new season of life.

If this isn't your first time on the Internet, then I'm sure you've seen your fair share of bogus promises and 'too good to be true' solutions to every problem in life.

I mean, really, you just get a decent camera with a few lights and pay your cousin to edit a video together with some bootlegged music - and BAM. You're some amazing service from the interweb.

Some people asked me - "So... *is this gSchool thing really legit?"*

It is, I can assure you.

And looking back - I don't know that I ever questioned the intent of any of the instructors. I believed they believed in their product... *but was it for me*?

- Was it a wise investment?
- Was it *really* the right timing?
- Would I leave in 6 months having spent *hours* and *$$$* getting trained in something I could just do on my own?

I feel those are valid questions. It's not a small thing - to lock yourself into 20k and move across the country. Especially when you're planted. When you're doing life with some of the closest friends and family you've ever had.

I can remember getting the email about my acceptance and racing home to tell my wife. We walked in the door, I shared the news, ... and then I just sat down, almost unable to stand.

YES! I made it in! This is what I've wanted and strived for, and this could be a defining moment in our family! ...BUT JEEZ... Do we really want to leave this community? These people who daily challenge and empower us? Who we've laughed and bled and wept with?

*Yes*, there's always the opportunity to come back... but there's no guarantee. Who knows where we'll be lead after this season?

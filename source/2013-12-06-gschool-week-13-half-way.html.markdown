// For this project, groups are taking a more serious approach to project management. How does that work with your style? Does it make you feel more organized or like you're wasting a lot of time?

// What's been hard, interesting, or surprising about building upon someone else's code base?
Interestingly enough, it hasn't just been all sunshine and rainbows working with
my previous project. I mean, you tend to like your own baby and everything, but
sometimes you just want to throw the whole thing away and start fresh. New
beginnings, fresh codebase, etc.

It's like when you get a new computer --- going back through your old files and
structure to clean them up is a significant chore, and the thought of a hard
drive bon fire seems more and more appealing as you continue on. Or you just
shove the files on some external hard drive somewhere that you swear to come
back to, but you force yourself to forget like those

Also - I think it can be hard to retrofit pre-existing code to make it work in
a new way, even if those ways are similar. The previous code base can put
limitations on how you're viewing the problem as well - seeing solutions through
the funnel of someone else's decisions (especially if they were your own).

// With the class just past the halfway mark, how do you feel about your progress? Do you feel like your momentum is building or waning?

//What did you think about the Young Entrepreneurs project we kicked off yesterday?

> I am a thing of beauty. - *Frank Sinatra*

This past week, we officially jumped our of the terminal for running programs,
and into the web. That's right, folks, we are officially, "Singing with
[Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)"... well... at least we're *striving* to
sing!

It was a bit of a jump for some - and new mentalities and processes (
rack testing, code organization, etc) most definitely added to list of things
to learn and *understand*. It's been great though - to not only be writing Ruby
applications that work through the terminal, but to venture towards our hopeful
finish line ofi being able to plan and develop full fledged web applications
and web services.

I had the opportunity to read through a book the week before, [Jump Start
Sinatra](http://www.sitepoint.com/store/jump-start-sinatra/) by
[sitepoint](http://sitepoint.com). And quite honestly, even though I had
previously known a bit about how the web works - it brough some new concepts
to the table, along with the new Sinatra skills.

The real meat of how Sinatra works definitely came from our class time though,
going over what Sinatra is - how the web works with HTTP - and how we should
correctly structure our Sinatra apps.

It's been an incredibly fun week!

We started a project, called,
[IdeaBox](http://bit.ly/16Uyusn)

I've been challenged with this project, though. With my previous experience
programming frontend, I could easily spend hours upon hours concentrating on
how my application looks and responds to the user. There has even been an
internal pull for me to add [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com) to the project -
just so I can get the practice.

I've realized though, that if I allow myself to go down that far into the rabbit
hole - I'll return with an application that maybe looks nice... but doesn't
stretch my abilities as a Ruby programmer.

And so - I've decided that until I finish the extensions for the project,
I won't be concentrating on any frontend work. Tough, but *good*.

Ultimately, I didn't come here to become a better frontend developer...

I came here to learn Ruby, *and so I shall*.

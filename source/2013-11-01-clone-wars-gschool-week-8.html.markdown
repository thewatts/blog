This week, in an effort to give us some extra exposure to how the web works, we
were given a new project - [Clone
Wars](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/clone_wars.html).

The goal of this project was to pick from a list of given websites, and clone
the website using [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com),
[Mechanize](https://github.com/sparklemotion/mechanize), and
[Sequel](https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel).

It was a fun project, and and there were plenty of opportunities to learn along
the way.

Not only was this project an opportunity for more Sinatra/Web exposure - but it
was our first project as a team. Up until that point, we had worked on projects
in pairs, individually, and as individuals in groups. Now, this was a different
opportunity. A taste of things to come for our upcoming massive group projects.

Honestly, our group was great! From a communication standpoint, I feel we rocked
it. We communicated well, had a great time working together, and had many laughs
along the way (#wednesday). And ultimately, I'm really thankful for having had
the opportunity to work with each other.

My only wish for this project, would be to have had more time. As a crew, though
the four of us had our individual goals met, we didn't fully accomplish the goal of
finishing the project.

But that's okay! It was a learning project, and opportunity to grow in multiple
areas - for all of us! We just had a larger vision than what we ended with.

My biggest areas of growth:

- Communication: sometimes I fail to properly communicate/explain what I'm
  thinking or trying to do - I was able to get plenty of practice doing so in
  this project.

- Humility: This project was an opportunity for me to humble myself and put my
  own desires aside a bit. My perfectionist tendencies wanted to finish the
  project, but that wasn't the overarching goal. The goal was for us to work
  well as a team, and to ensure that we all learned how Sinatra and Ruby and the
  Web work together. *That* was significantly more important.

I can honestly say though, I'm incredibly excited for our next group project.
Working with this many people was a true pleasure - and I can't wait to start
